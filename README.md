## Abstract

User-generated 360° video content is gaining popularity due to the widespread availability of low-cost acquisition devices and its inherently immersive nature. However, such videos often suffer from unpredictable real-world artifacts including handheld camera motion, illumination variability, compression impairments, and accidental occlusions, which are characteristic of non-professional acquisition settings. As these videos are increasingly shared on online social media platforms and consumed via head-mounted displays (HMDs), reliable quality assessment becomes essential.

To address this need, we introduce **RUG360**, a real-world 360° video quality assessment dataset designed specifically for user-generated content. The dataset comprises randomly captured source videos spanning multiple content categories and recorded under three environmental conditions: indoor, outdoor-day, and outdoor-night. Distorted video sequences are generated using three widely adopted video codecs—H.264 (AVC), H.265 (HEVC), and VP9—across varying bitrates and quantization parameters.

Subjective quality evaluation is conducted using an HMD-based experimental setup following the Modified Absolute Category Rating (ACR) protocol. In addition, Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) assessments are performed to capture time-dependent viewer discomfort, in accordance with ITU-T P.919 recommendations. Benchmark evaluations using existing video quality assessment metrics are reported. The RUG360 dataset is intended to support research in video quality assessment and immersive media quality analysis.

## Usage
The RUG360 dataset is intended for research in **video quality assessment (VQA), quality of experience (QoE), and immersive media analysis**. Researchers can use this dataset to:
1. Benchmark their video quality models.
2. Train and evaluate new VQA algorithms.
3. Study the impact of real-world distortions in 360° videos.
