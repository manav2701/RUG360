## Abstract
User-generated 360° video content is gaining popularity due to availability of
low-cost acquisition devices and its inherent immersive nature. However, such
videos often exhibit unpredictable real-world artifacts including handheld camera
motion, illumination variability, compression impairments, and accidental occlusions which are specific for user-generated videos. Therefore, it is necessary for
assessing quality of such videos before they are shared over the online social media
platforms and consumed through head mounted displays. In this direction, there
is a necessity of a dataset having user-generated 360° videos with specific distortions related to acquisition in non-professional setting. To address this gap, we
introduce RUG360, a real-world 360° video quality assessment dataset designed
to consider user-generated content specific distortion aware videos along with mean opinion scores. RUG360 consists of randomly captured source videos covering multiple category types that are recorded across three conditions, indoor,
outdoor-day, and outdoor-night environments. The impaired sequences are generated using three standard codecs H.264, H.265, and VP9 at varying bitrate
and quantization parameters. Subjective quality evaluation is conducted using
an HMD-based using Modified Absolute Category Rating protocol, along with
Simulator Sickness Questionnaire assessments to capture time-dependent viewer
discomfort in accordance with ITU-T P.919 recommendations. We implement
benchmark quality assessment metric on RUG360 dataset and report the results.
The dataset is made publicly available for testing quality assessment models

## Usage
The RUG360 dataset is intended for research in **video quality assessment (VQA), quality of experience (QoE), and immersive media analysis**. Researchers can use this dataset to:
1. Benchmark their video quality models.
2. Train and evaluate new VQA algorithms.
3. Study the impact of real-world distortions in 360° videos.
