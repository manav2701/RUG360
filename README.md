## Abstract

User-generated 360° video content is becoming increasingly popular due to the availability of low-cost acquisition devices and its inherently immersive nature. To facilitate research and development in this area, we introduce **RBD-360**, a dataset designed explicitly for quality assessment of user-generated 360° videos that includes various distortions typical of non-professional settings.

RBD-360 features a collection of randomly captured source videos across multiple categories, recorded in three different environments: **indoor**, **outdoor-day**, and **outdoor-night**. The impaired video sequences are created using three standard codecs—**H.264**, **H.265**, and **VP9**—at varying bitrates and quantization parameters.

To evaluate subjective video quality, we employed an **HMD-based Modified Absolute Category Rating (ACR)** protocol, along with assessments from the **Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)**. This setup captures time-dependent viewer discomfort in accordance with **ITU-T P.919 recommendations**.

We implement benchmark quality assessment metrics on the RBD-360 dataset and report the results. The dataset is publicly available for testing quality assessment models tailored for user-generated 360° videos.

## Usage
The RUG360 dataset is intended for research in **video quality assessment (VQA), quality of experience (QoE), and immersive media analysis**. Researchers can use this dataset to:
1. Benchmark their video quality models.
2. Train and evaluate new VQA algorithms.
3. Study the impact of real-world distortions in 360° videos.
